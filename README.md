# docker-iobroker
Docker image for ioBroker (http://iobroker.net) based on debian:stretch (http://hub.docker.com/_/debian/)

This project creates a Docker image for running ioBroker in a Docker container. It is made for and tested on a Synology Disk Station 1515+ with DSM 6 and Docker-package installed. But it should also work on other systems with Docker installed!

## Important

Switching an existing installation from docker-iobroker-image v1 to v2 or greater means switching iobroker itself from node6 to node8! This requires additional steps inside ioBroker! After upgrading iobroker-container you have to call "reinstall.sh" for recompiling your installation for the use with node8. For Details see official ioBroker-documentation (http://www.iobroker.net/docu/?page_id=8323&lang=de). Make backup first!!!

## Installation & Usage

A detailed tutorial (german, based on new v3.0.0) can be found here: [https://buanet.de](https://buanet.de/2019/05/iobroker-unter-docker-auf-der-synology-diskstation-v3/). Please notice that the old tutorial does no longer work!

For discussion and support please visit [ioBroker-forum-thread](http://forum.iobroker.net/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=5089) or use the comments section at the linked tutorial. Please do not contact me directly for any support-reasons. Every support-question should be answered in a public place. Thank you.

## Special Settings

In v3.0.0 I added some new features. The following will give some short information about that.

### Environment Variables

|env|value|description|
|---|---|---|
|PACKAGES|package1 package2 package2|seperateed by whitespace; will install the listed packages on startup<br>(be paitient, this may take some time!)|
|AVAHI|true|will install and activate avahi-daemon for supporting yahka-adapter|
|LANGUAGE|de_DE:de|following locales are pre-generated: de_DE:de, en_US:en|
|LANG|de_DE.UTF-8|following locales are pre-generated: de_DE.UTF-8, en_US.UTF-8|
|LC_ALL|de_DE|following locales are pre-generated: de_DE.UTF-8, en_US.UTF-8|
|TZ|Europe/Berlin|all valid Linux-timezones|
|SETUID|1000|for security reasons it might be useful to specify the uid of the containers iobroker user to match an existing user on the docker host|
|SETGID|1000|for security reasons it might be useful to specify the gid of the containers iobroker user to match an existing group on the docker host|

### Mounting Folder/ Volume

It is now possible to mount an empty folder to /opt/iobroker during first startup of the container. The Startupscript will check this folder and restore content if empty.

It is absolutely recommended to use a mounted folder or persistent volume for /opt/iobroker folder!

This also works with mounting a folder containing an existing ioBroker-installation (e.g. when moving an existing installation to docker). 

### Permission Fixer

I added some code for fixing permissions for new iobroker-user. Permission-fixing is called on first start of the container. This might take a few minutes. Please take a look at the logs and be patient!
